Hello, I am Selmir Avdic, a novice in computer programing and an amateur in game programing and design, pursuing a computer science bachelor degree and then masters. Coming from Europe and living in an apartment I had my first experience in gaming at the early age of four, DOS Mario was that gameâ€™s name. After that it was game after game till I eventually decided to pursue the computer science industry. Going all the way to now, 2018, I find myself with a team of four others, working on a website with a roughly working Mario game and a database to save the screen name of all the winners. As for my first time experiencing game design with a language I understand I was an amazing first time

	Hello, I'm Ali Shaikh, I'm a computer science student in North American University studying both software engineering and computer networking. I was born in Bellflower, California
	(located somewhere in Los Angeles). I developed interest in computer when I was in my junior year at Harmony School of Innovation- Sugar Land. When I first got my computer, I used it to play computers, but not only games,I can also
	experiment coding and other good stuff. I got introduced to programming languages like Java along with HTML and CSS slowly, so I can use it in the assignments and projects.
	In future after graduating in 2020, I plan to attend grad schools like University of Houston Main Campus, University of Texas- Austin to develop deeper knowledge
	in software engineering and computer networking, so I can take up a research opportunity to expand his skills and performance. Besides being a hardworking computer science
	student, I also like to play games, sing, workout and listen to music and podcast. I also plan to expand in my Spanish language skills and learn other languages like
	Italian, French and etc. So the project I'm doing is on Mario Game, like ghost Mario, a customized game and the parts of the game is split into 5 with my team. I'm doing
	the about the game consisting of the creator's biography, about Mario, and how to play the game. I hope this project is successful so I can venture into
	other great projects. My favorite bands are Queen, REO Speedwagon, Diesel, Joe Satriani, etc., their songs are like a meditation to me so I can feel positive. Also, in computer
	world, I plan to build more websites using Parallax and blogging site as a computer scientist along with researching artificial intelligence.
