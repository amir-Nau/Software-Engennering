Overview: So now, Oscar uploaded the sign in page into GitHub with the CSS and HTML pages. Oscar explained the team members how the UML diagram works, the UML diagram basically represents the way how the game is going to look like. Amir showed Oscar and me the YouTube video, "Video As A Background For Website |HTML, CSS". Amir is showing us the brainstorming ideas. For the welcoming page Amir showed me, I'm going to put my username  and it'll take me to the Welcome page of the game. The layout page is being planned for each of us team members to see how our portion will look like. So Oscar showed me the layout of how I'm designing the About the Game page by dividing it into three: the Creator of the Mario Games, the Website, and how the game is played. Our goal from now until the end of October through November, is to work on our portions and collaborate with each other to see how the progress is coming.
