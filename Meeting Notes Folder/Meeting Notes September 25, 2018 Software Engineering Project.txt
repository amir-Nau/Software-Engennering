Overview: 
So far, we've been working on the website with some changes. Oscar sent Blessing and me the YouTube playlist, it's by thenewboston, to learn about creating website using HTML and CSS. So now, Blessing is going to create the team page, which is about us. Amir taught Blessing to create the page using the site called BigDropinc, which has picture on one side and the description. We as team members decided to post our own description for the about team members page and uploaded to GitHub repository before fitting it in later. The goal for right now is for us to catch up with learning basic things like HTML and CSS, which is needed for the website portion along with JavaScript and everything. As mentioned, Oscar is going to be creating database and sign up page work and I would be doing the about the game description.
