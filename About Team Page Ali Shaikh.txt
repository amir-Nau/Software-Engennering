Hello, I'm Ali Shaikh, I'm a computer science student in North American University studying both software engineering and computer networking. I was born in Bellflower, California
(located somewhere in Los Angeles). I developed interest in computer when I was in my junior year at Harmony School of Innovation- Sugar Land. When I first got my computer, I used it to play computers, but not only games,I can also
experiment coding and other good stuff. I got introduced to programming languages like Java along with HTML and CSS slowly, so I can use it in the assignments and projects.
In future after graduating in 2020, I plan to attend grad schools like University of Houston Main Campus, University of Texas- Austin to develop deeper knowledge
in software engineering and computer networking, so I can take up a research opportunity to expand his skills and performance. Besides being a hardworking computer science
student, I also like to play games, sing, workout and listen to music and podcast. I also plan to expand in my Spanish language skills and learn other languages like
Italian, French and etc. So the project I'm doing is on Mario Game, like ghost Mario, a customized game and the parts of the game is split into 5 with my team. I'm doing 
the about the game consisting of the creator's biography, about Mario, and how to play the game. I hope this project is successful so I can venture into
other great projects. My favorite bands are Queen, REO Speedwagon, Diesel, Joe Satriani, etc., their songs are like a meditation to me so I can feel positive. Also, in computer
world, I plan to build more websites using Parallax and blogging site as a computer scientist along with researching artificial intelligence.
